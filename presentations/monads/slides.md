# "A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"

# A monad is a box you can put things in.

<div class="mt-8 text-lg opacity-70">

that's it. that's the tweet. let's unpack it.

# The Problem

ok so things go wrong. Values might be missing. And Python makes you deal with it like this.

<v-click>

```python
user = get_user(42)           # might return None
if user is not None:
    address = get_address(user)
    if address is not None:
        postcode = get_postcode(address)
        if postcode is not None:
            print(postcode)
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4" style="color: #d4639a">

girl every step needs a check. this is four levels of nesting and we only have three functions.

there has to be a better way.

</div>

</v-click>

# A Smarter Box: Maybe

what if the box just... handled it?

<v-click>

```python
class Maybe:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def bind(self, func):
        if self.value is None:
            return Maybe(None)    # empty? skip it
        return func(self.value)   # otherwise, run the function
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

```python
# Same example as before — but now the box handles the None checks
Maybe(42).bind(get_user).bind(get_address).bind(get_postcode)

# If get_user returns Maybe(None), the chain stops.
# No ifs. No crashes. No pyramid of doom.
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div style="color: #d4639a">

she handles the emptiness between steps for you ✨

</div>

</v-click>

# The Same Trick, Different Box: Lists

ok but what if the box has *multiple things in it*? bind means: apply a function to each one, and flatten the results.

<v-click>

```python
def expand(x):
    return [x, x * 10]

# bind: apply to each element, flatten
[1, 2, 3]  →  expand each  →  [1, 10, 2, 20, 3, 30]
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

You already do this — it's a list comprehension:

```python
[(x, y) for x in [1, 2, 3] for y in ['a', 'b']]
# [(1,'a'), (1,'b'), (2,'a'), (2,'b'), (3,'a'), (3,'b')]
```

Each `for` is a bind. The list box handles the iteration and combination for you.

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4" style="color: #9b72cf">

Maybe handles missing values. List handles multiple values. same pattern, different girl 💅

</div>

</v-click>

# The Pattern

so what do these boxes have in common? three ingredients:

<v-clicks>

1. **A box type** — wraps a value
   - `Maybe(42)`, `[1, 2, 3]`

2. **Wrap** — put a value in the box
   - `Maybe(x)`, `[x]`

3. **Bind** — chain operations: `box.bind(f)` gives you a new box
   - Maybe's bind skips if empty
   - List's bind applies to each element and flattens

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4" style="color: #d4639a">

a box + wrap + bind. that's a monad. that's the whole thing :3

where a class hides **state**, a monad hides **control flow**.

</div>

# Lifting: What a Functor Does

A functor takes a function between values and **lifts** it to a function between boxes.

<v-click>

<div class="mt-8 flex justify-center">
<div class="text-center">

<div class="flex items-center gap-4 justify-center text-xl">
  <div class="px-4 py-2 rounded" style="background: rgba(155, 114, 207, 0.2)">5</div>
  <div>──<code>double</code>──→</div>
  <div class="px-4 py-2 rounded" style="background: rgba(155, 114, 207, 0.2)">10</div>
</div>

<div class="flex items-center gap-4 justify-center my-4 text-sm opacity-60">
  <div>↓ wrap in list</div>
  <div class="w-24"></div>
  <div>↓ wrap in list</div>
</div>

<div class="flex items-center gap-4 justify-center text-xl">
  <div class="px-4 py-2 rounded" style="background: rgba(212, 99, 154, 0.2)">[5]</div>
  <div>──<code>map(double)</code>──→</div>
  <div class="px-4 py-2 rounded" style="background: rgba(212, 99, 154, 0.2)">[10]</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-8 text-center">

```python
def double(x):  return x * 2       # a function between numbers
list(map(double, [5]))              # the same function, between lists
```

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 text-center" style="color: #d4639a">

the box doesn't change what the function does — it just lets it work on boxed values.

every monad is a functor. this is what <code>map</code> means. she's beautiful.

</div>

</v-click>

# The Three Rules

ok so what makes a box a *monad* and not just a box?

<v-clicks>

1. **Left identity:** `Maybe(a).bind(f)` = `f(a)`
   - Putting a value in a box and immediately using it should be the same as just using it. The box doesn't get in the way.

2. **Right identity:** `m.bind(Maybe)` = `m`
   - If all you do is re-wrap the value, nothing changes. The box doesn't add anything you didn't ask for.

3. **Associativity:** `m.bind(f).bind(g)` = `m.bind(lambda x: f(x).bind(g))`
   - It doesn't matter how you group a chain of operations — the result is the same. You can refactor freely.

</v-clicks>

# The Result Monad

ok but Maybe has a problem — she just goes empty and doesn't tell you *why*. Result fixes this.

<v-click>

Two states:
- `Ok(value)` — it worked, here's the answer
- `Err(message)` — it failed, here's why

</v-click>

<v-click>

```python
def bind(self, func):
    if self.is_err:
        return self               # failed? carry the error forward
    return func(self.value)       # otherwise, keep going
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div style="color: #d4639a">

same bind, same pattern — but now the error message comes with her. no more silent failures.

</div>

</v-click>

# Putting It Together: A Data Pipeline

<v-click>

Without monads:

```python
data = read_csv("readings.csv")
if data is not None:
    column = parse_floats(data, "temperature")
    if column is not None:
        cleaned = remove_outliers(column)
        if cleaned is not None:
            result = mean(cleaned)
            if result is not None:
                print(f"Mean temperature: {result}")
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

With Result:

```python
result = (Result.ok("readings.csv")
    .bind(read_csv)
    .bind(lambda d: parse_floats(d, "temperature"))
    .bind(remove_outliers)
    .bind(mean))
# Ok(23.4) or Err("column 'temperature' contains non-numeric values")
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div style="color: #9b72cf">

same logic, no nesting. and if it fails, she tells you exactly where and why.

</div>

</v-click>

# Why the Weird Name?

<v-clicks>

- monads come from **category theory** — a branch of abstract maths
- Haskell borrowed the concept in the 1990s for handling side effects
- the *ideas* are simple; the *vocabulary* is intimidating
- most people learn monads by using them, then go "oh. *that's* what that was"

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-8 text-center text-xl" style="color: #d4639a">

you don't need the maths to use the pattern.

you just need a box and a chain.
