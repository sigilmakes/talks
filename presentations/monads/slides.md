# What the hell is a Monad?

# "A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors"

<div class="mt-8 text-2xl" style="color: #d4639a">

...yeah, let's ignore that.

</div>

# Classes Are Boxes

You already use boxes every day. A class wraps data and gives you methods to work with it.

<v-click>

```python
class Box:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value           # put a thing in the box

    def apply(self, func):
        return Box(func(self.value)) # do something to what's inside
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

```python
Box(5).apply(lambda x: x * 2)   # Box(10)
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4" style="color: #9b72cf">

Simple enough. But what happens when the thing inside might not be there?

</div>

</v-click>

---

# The Problem

Things go wrong. Values might be missing. And Python makes you deal with it manually.

<v-click>

```python
user = get_user(42)           # might return None
if user is not None:
    address = get_address(user)
    if address is not None:
        postcode = get_postcode(address)
        if postcode is not None:
            print(postcode)
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4" style="color: #d4639a">

Every step needs a check. It gets worse the more steps you have.

What if the box could handle this for us?

</div>

</v-click>

---

# A Smarter Box: Maybe

What if our box *knew* it might be empty — and handled that automatically?

<v-click>

```python
class Maybe:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

    def bind(self, func):
        if self.value is None:
            return Maybe(None)    # empty? skip it
        return func(self.value)   # otherwise, run the function

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Maybe({self.value})"
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

```python
def half(x):
    return Maybe(x // 2) if x % 2 == 0 else Maybe(None)

Maybe(16).bind(half).bind(half).bind(half)              # Maybe(2)
Maybe(16).bind(half).bind(half).bind(half).bind(half)   # Maybe(None)
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div style="color: #d4639a">

No ifs. No crashes. The box handles the emptiness between steps.

</div>

</v-click>

# The Same Trick, Different Box: Lists

A list is a box that holds **multiple values at once**. Bind means: apply a function to each one, and flatten the results.

<v-click>

```python
def expand(x):
    return [x, x * 10]

# bind: apply to each element, flatten
[1, 2, 3]  →  expand each  →  [1, 10, 2, 20, 3, 30]
```

</v-click>

<v-click>

You already do this — it's a list comprehension:

```python
[(x, y) for x in [1, 2, 3] for y in ['a', 'b']]
# [(1,'a'), (1,'b'), (2,'a'), (2,'b'), (3,'a'), (3,'b')]
```

Each `for` is a bind. The list box handles the iteration and combination for you.

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4" style="color: #9b72cf">

Maybe handles missing values. List handles multiple values. Same pattern.

</div>

</v-click>

# The Pattern

So what do these boxes have in common? Three ingredients:

<v-clicks>

1. **A box type** — wraps a value
   - `Maybe(42)`, `[1, 2, 3]`

2. **A way to put things in** — wrap a value in the box
   - `Maybe(x)`, `[x]`

3. **A way to chain** — `bind`: take a boxed value, apply a function, get a new box
   - Maybe's bind skips if empty
   - List's bind applies to each element and flattens

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4" style="color: #d4639a">

A box + a way in + a way to chain. That's a monad.

Where a class hides **state**, a monad hides **control flow**.

</div>

# Lifting: What a Functor Does

A functor takes a function between values and **lifts** it to a function between boxes.

<v-click>

<div class="mt-8 flex justify-center">
<div class="text-center">

<div class="flex items-center gap-4 justify-center text-xl">
  <div class="px-4 py-2 rounded" style="background: rgba(155, 114, 207, 0.2)">5</div>
  <div>──<code>double</code>──→</div>
  <div class="px-4 py-2 rounded" style="background: rgba(155, 114, 207, 0.2)">10</div>
</div>

<div class="flex items-center gap-4 justify-center my-4 text-sm opacity-60">
  <div>↓ wrap in list</div>
  <div class="w-24"></div>
  <div>↓ wrap in list</div>
</div>

<div class="flex items-center gap-4 justify-center text-xl">
  <div class="px-4 py-2 rounded" style="background: rgba(212, 99, 154, 0.2)">[5]</div>
  <div>──<code>map(double)</code>──→</div>
  <div class="px-4 py-2 rounded" style="background: rgba(212, 99, 154, 0.2)">[10]</div>
</div>

</div>
</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-8 text-center">

```python
def double(x):  return x * 2       # a function between numbers
list(map(double, [5]))              # the same function, between lists
```

</div>

</v-click>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4 text-center" style="color: #d4639a">

The box doesn't change what the function does — it just lets it work on boxed values.

Every monad is a functor. This is what <code>map</code> means.

</div>

</v-click>

# The Three Rules

What makes a box a *monad* and not just a box? Three rules:

<v-clicks>

1. **Wrapping then chaining does nothing extra** — if you put a value in a box and immediately chain a function, it's the same as just calling the function
   - *Putting something in a box shouldn't change it*

2. **Chaining with "just re-wrap it" does nothing** — if your chain function just puts the value back in a box, you get the same box
   - *The box shouldn't add anything you didn't ask for*

3. **Chaining is associative** — it doesn't matter how you group a sequence of chains, the result is the same
   - *Like how (1+2)+3 = 1+(2+3)*

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-4" style="color: #d4639a">

These guarantee your chains are predictable. No weird surprises from ordering.

</div>

</v-click>

# Why the Weird Name?

<v-clicks>

- Monads come from **category theory** — a branch of abstract maths
- Haskell borrowed the concept in the 1990s for handling side effects
- The *ideas* are simple; the *vocabulary* is intimidating
- Most people learn monads by using them, then realise what they were

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

<div class="mt-8 text-center text-xl" style="color: #d4639a">

You don't need the maths to use the pattern.

You just need a box and a chain.
